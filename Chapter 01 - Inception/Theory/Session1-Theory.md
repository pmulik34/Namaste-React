## Q: What is `Emmet`?
ans: Emmet is tool that helps developers write HTML and CSS code more quickly and easily. It works by letting developers use short abbreviations instead of typing out long lines of code. Then with the click of button or the press of a key, Emmet can expand these abbreviations into full HTML and CSS code. This can save a lot of time and make coding less tedious.
